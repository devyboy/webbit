# Webbit
A Reddit clone built with React and Firebase. Basic functionalities are there like voting and commenting and stuff, but still needs things like a settings page or upvoting replies. I'm not trying to make the next revolutionary social media, this was just a fun personal project.
## Installation
I mean it's a web app so you could just go to the URL to see it in action. If you wanna mess around with it just git clone and npm install it like normal. You would need to put your own firebase api keys credentials into a file called config.js as dictated in App.js. 
## Sign in? This seems risky...
Well there's the option to sign in with your Facebook/Google/Twitter account as well as just an email address. You don't need to verify (if you want to for some reason just click the checkbox when signing up) your email so technically it doesn't really matter what you use.
